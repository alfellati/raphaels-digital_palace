## Description

The purpose of a "Today I Learned" (TIL) blog is to document and share small, bite-sized pieces of knowledge or insights that an individual has learned on a particular day.

It serves as a personal knowledge base where individuals can record and reflect on their daily learning experiences.

TIL blogs are often used by programmers, developers, and other professionals to share tips, tricks, and lessons learned in their respective fields.

They can also be a valuable resource for others who are looking to learn and expand their knowledge in a specific domain.

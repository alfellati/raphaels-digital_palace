My new favorite prompting strategy: “Chain of Thought Leaders Prompting” It works by leveraging the thousands of books that Large Language Models have access to from their training data to provide the most useful insights from the most important thought leaders on any given topic. It then uses the power of chain of thought prompting to explore topics more deeply by enhancing context with the wisdom of thought leaders. Here is the full “Chain of Thought Leaders” prompt series (enter each step as a separate prompt after you have received a response to the previous prompt): Prompt 1: Identify the top books by thought leaders in [topic] Prompt 2: Provide a comprehensive summary list of the key ideas from each of these books relevant to [topic]. Aim for 5 bullet points for each book. Prompt 3: Synthesize the ideas above into actionable insights related to [topic], focusing on their implications and applications. Prompt 4: Form a cohesive straightforward narrative that integrates these insights into a comprehensive overview of [topic], addressing its key aspects and implications. Prompt 5: Refine the narrative to ensure it is clear and comprehensive. Provide a summary that encapsulates the essential insights and perspectives on [topic].
